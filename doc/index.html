<p>This is the accompanying page for the article <em>Dequantization of a signal from two parallel
quantized observations</em> authored by VojtÄ›ch Kovanda and Pavel Rajmic, submitted to ICASSP 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We propose a technique of signal acquisition using a combination of two devices with different sampling rates and quantization accuracies. Subsequent processing involving sparsity regularization enables us to reconstruct the signal at such a sampling frequency and with such a bit depth that was not possible using the two devices independently. Objective and subjective tests show the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with alternatives.</p>
